The Easy Setup Project
======================

**Problem:** getting a development environment set up to work on this project, while not difficult, is a rather involved process.

The Easy Setup project aims to solve this by providing a few things:

1.  Access to a minimal dev environment via an SSH terminal to the development server
2.  A Vagrantfile so that a VM can be created with only the contents of the git repository as a requirement (beyond those of Vagrant, itself, of course)
3.  Some way to configure an already-available VM image (see number 2, above), with appropriate virtual environments, language dependencies or whatever else a particular project might need before it could be worked on.
